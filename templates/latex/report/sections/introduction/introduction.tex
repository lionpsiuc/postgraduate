\section{Introduction}

Introduce the topic and set the context for the rest of the document. We can cite a source by using the \lstinline|\citet{}| command for textual citations, where the author's name is part of the narrative (e.g., \citet{vaswani2017attention} shows us that this is true), or \lstinline|\citep{}| for parenthetical citations, where the caption appears in parentheses (e.g., some fact from some paper \citep{vaswani2017attention}). Note that these citations follow the APA format.
